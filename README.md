## DynaFire
Dynamo Keyboard Shortcuts Extension

## Purpose/Use
Create shortcuts to place commonly used nodes in the workspace.
Shortcuts are 2 letter combinations, press and hold the first letter while pressing the second.  
For example, press 'K', hold it down, then press 'S'.  This opens the keyboard shortcut editing dialog.

## Install
Download atleast the deploy folder.  There is an install bat file that should install the extension, and place a starting saved shortcut file into a user app data folder.  *%AppData&\DynaFire\*

## Resources

This project was started at the #beyondAEC hackathon, held in Boston.

Note, this is very much a work in progress.  At the time of this writing there are known issues which WILL cause Dynamo to crash.
Use at your own risk, and please contribute.  We all want this project to get better :-)
