# DynaFire
Dynamo Keyboard Shortcuts Extension

This addin should help users add customizable shortucts to DynamoBIM, a visual programing language for the AEC industry. 
Autodesk is working on the open source project to encourage automation, but they needed a little help adding the shortcut functionality.
This project was started at the #beyondAEC hackathon, held in Boston.

the solution should compile, and the goal is that if all you want is to add the extension, then the deploy folder should have all you need.

Note, this is very much a work in progress.  At the time of this writing there are known issues which WILL cause Dynamo to crash.
Use at your own risk, and please contribute.  We all want this project to get better :-)
